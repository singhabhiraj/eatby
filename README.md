# Eatby - Android App for Finding Restaurants nearby

EatBy is a Restaurant Tracker Application which was developed on Android Studio. We were a team of 4 students who developed this mobile application. My role was to design the functional flow of this application. This app can help anyone to find a place to eat in a new city and has the below capabilities:

- Location-based search and suggestion — a core function for a food finder.
- Restaurant profile — here users can learn whether any of that hip closest restaurants is actually serving the food they like.
- Calling from the app — booking a table in food places nearby should be easy.
- Admin panel — a place for managing and moderating content for your restaurant locator app.
- Registration via Social Network - using Google Accounts
